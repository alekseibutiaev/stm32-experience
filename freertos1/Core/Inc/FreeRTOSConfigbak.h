  configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION

  If configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION is set to 1 then RTOS objects can be createdusing RAM provided by
  the application writer.

  If configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION is set to 0 then RTOS objects can only be created using RAM
  allocated from the FreeRTOS heap.

  If configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION is left undefined it will default to 0.

  If configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION is set to 1 then the application writer must also provide two
  callback functions: vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory() to provide the memory for use by the RTOS Idle
  task, and (if configUSE_TIMERS is set to 1) vApplicationGetTimerTaskMemory() to provide memory for
  use by the RTOS Daemon/Timer Service task. Examples are provided below.

  configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION is set to 1, so the application must provide an
  implementation of vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory() to provide the memory that is
  used by the Idle task.

    *pulIdleTaskStackSize = configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE;
  }

  configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION and configUSE_TIMERS are both set to 1, so the
  application must provide an implementation of vApplicationGetTimerTaskMemory()
  to provide the memory that is used by the Timer service task.

  void vApplicationGetTimerTaskMemory(StaticTask_t** ppxTimerTaskTCBBuffer,
      StackType_t** ppxTimerTaskStackBuffer, uint32_t *pulTimerTaskStackSize) {
    // If the buffers to be provided to the Timer task are declared inside this

  vPortFreeStack function. The user need to provide thread-safe implementations of pvPortMallocStack
  and vPortFreeStack functions. This enables the user to allocate stacks for tasks from a separate
  region of memory (possibly another heap different from the FreeRTOS heap).

  If configSTACK_ALLOCATION_FROM_SEPARATE_HEAP is left undefined it will default to 0.

  Example implementation of pvPortMallocStack and vPortFreeStack functions is below:

/*
  configUSE_IDLE_HOOK

  Set to 1 if you wish to use an idle hook, or 0 to omit an idle hook.

  An idle task hook is a function that is called during each cycle of the idle task. If you want
  application functionality to run at the idle priority then there are two options:

    1) Implement the functionality in an idle task hook.

      There must always be at least one task that is ready to run. It is therefore imperative that
      the hook function does not call any API functions that might cause the idle task to block
      (vTaskDelay(), or a queue or semaphore function with a block time, for example). It is ok for
      co-routines to block within the hook function.

    2) Create an idle priority task to implement the functionality.

      This is a more flexible solution but has a higher RAM usage overhead.

  See the (Embedded software application design) <https://www.freertos.org/tutorial/index.html>
  section for more information on using an idle hook.

  To create an idle hook:

    1) Set configUSE_IDLE_HOOK to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

    2) Define a function that has the following name and prototype:

    void vApplicationIdleHook(void);

  It is common to use the idle hook function to place the microcontroller CPU into a power saving mode. 
*/

#define configUSE_IDLE_HOOK 0

/*
  configUSE_TICK_HOOK

  Set to 1 if you wish to use an (tick hook)<https://www.freertos.org/a00016.html#TickHook>, or 0
  to omit an tick hook.

  Tick Hook Function

  The tick interrupt can optionally call an application defined hook (or callback) function - the
  tick hook. The tick hook provides a convenient place to implement timer functionality.

  The tick hook will only get called if configUSE_TICK_HOOK is set to 1 within FreeRTOSConfig.h.
  When this is set the application must provide the hook function with the following prototype:

  void vApplicationTickHook(voi );

  vApplicationTickHook() executes from within an ISR so must be very short, not use much stack, and
  not call any API functions that don't end in "FromISR" or "FROM_ISR".

  See the (demo application file crhook.c) <https://www.freertos.org/a00013.html#crhook> for an
  example of how to use a tick hook.
*/

#define configUSE_TICK_HOOK 0

/*
  configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW

  The (stack overflow detection)<https://www.freertos.org/Stacks-and-stack-overflow-checking.html>
  page describes the use of this parameter.

  Each task maintains its own stack. If a task is created using xTaskCreate() then the memory used
  as the task's stack is allocated automatically from the FreeRTOS heap, and dimensioned by a
  parameter passed to the xTaskCreate() API function. If a task is created using xTaskCreateStatic()
  then the memory used as the task's stack is pre-allocated by the application writer. Stack
  overflow is a very common cause of application instability. FreeRTOS therefore provides two
  optional mechanisms that can be used to assist in the detection and correction of just such an
  occurrence. The option used is configured using the configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW configuration
  constant.

  Note that these options are only available on architectures where the memory map is not segmented.
  Also, some processors could generate a fault or exception in response to a stack corruption before
  the RTOS kernel overflow check can occur. The application must provide a stack overflow hook
  function if configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW is not set to 0. The hook function must be called
  vApplicationStackOverflowHook(), and have the prototype below:


  void vApplicationStackOverflowHook(TaskHandle_t xTask, signed char *pcTaskName);

  The xTask and pcTaskName parameters pass to the hook function the handle and name of the offending
  task respectively. Note however, depending on the severity of the overflow, these parameters could
  ggthemselves be corrupted, in which case the pxCurrentTCB variable can be inspected directly.

  Stack overflow checking introduces a context switch overhead so its use is only recommended during
  the development or testing phases.

  Stack Overflow Detection - Method 1
  
  It is likely that the stack will reach its greatest (deepest) value after the RTOS kernel has
  swapped the task out of the Running state because this is when the stack will contain the task
  context. At this point the RTOS kernel can check that the processor stack pointer remains within
  the valid stack space. The stack overflow hook function is called if the stack pointer contain a
  value that is outside of the valid stack range.

  This method is quick but not guaranteed to catch all stack overflows.
  Set configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW to 1 to use this method.

  Stack Overflow Detection - Method 2

  When a task is first created its stack is filled with a known value. When swapping a task out of
  the Running state the RTOS kernel can check the last 16 bytes within the valid stack range to
  ensure that these known values have not been overwritten by the task or interrupt activity.
  The stack overflow hook function is called should any of these 16 bytes not remain at their
  initial value.

  This method is less efficient than method one, but still fairly fast. It is very likely to catch
  stack overflows but is still not guaranteed to catch all overflows.

  Set configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW to 2 to use this method. 
*/

#define configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW 1

/*
  configUSE_MALLOC_FAILED_HOOK

  The kernel uses a call to pvPortMalloc() to allocate memory from the heap each time a task, queue
  or semaphore is created. The official FreeRTOS download includes four sample memory allocation
  schemes for this purpose. The schemes are implemented in the heap_1.c, heap_2.c, heap_3.c,
  heap_4.c and heap_5.c source files respectively. configUSE_MALLOC_FAILED_HOOK is only relevant
  when one of these three sample schemes is being used.

  The malloc() failed hook function is a hook (or callback) function that, if defined and configured,
  will be called if pvPortMalloc() ever returns NULL. NULL will be returned only if there is
  insufficient FreeRTOS heap memory remaining for the requested allocation to succeed.

  If configUSE_MALLOC_FAILED_HOOK is set to 1 then the application must define a malloc() failed
  hook function. If configUSE_MALLOC_FAILED_HOOK is set to 0 then the malloc() failed hook function
  will not be called, even if one is defined. Malloc() failed hook functions must have the name and
  prototype shown below.

  void vApplicationMallocFailedHook( void );
*/

#define configUSE_MALLOC_FAILED_HOOK  0

/*
  configUSE_DAEMON_TASK_STARTUP_HOOK

  If configUSE_TIMERS and configUSE_DAEMON_TASK_STARTUP_HOOK are both set to 1 then the application
  must define a hook function that has the exact name and prototype as shown below. The hook
  function will be called exactly once when the RTOS daemon task (also known as the 
  (timer service task<https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-software-timer-service-daemon-task.html>))
  executes for the first time. Any application initialisation code that needs the RTOS to be running
  can be placed in the hook function.

  receive complete callbacks, whereas stream and message buffers created with xStreamBufferCreate()
  and xStreamBufferCreateStatic() (and their message buffer equivalents) all share the callbacks
  defined by the sbSEND_COMPLETED() and sbRECEVE_COMPLETED() macros. configUSE_SB_COMPLETED_CALLBACK
  defaults to 0 for backward compatibility.

/*
  configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS
  The (Run Time Stats)<https://www.freertos.org/rtos-run-time-stats.html> page describes the use of
  this parameter.

  FreeRTOS can optionally collect information on the amount of processing time that has been used by
  each task. The vTaskGetRunTimeStats() API function can then be used to present this information in
  a tabular format, as shown on the right.

  Two values are given for each task:

    1) Abs Time (absolute time)

    This is the total 'time' that the task has actually been executing (the total time that the task
    has been in the Running state). It is up to the user to select a suitable time base for their
    application.

    2) Time (percentage time)

    This shows essentially the same information but as a percentage of the total processing time
    rather than as an absolute time.

  Configuration and Usage

  Three macros are required. These can be defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

  configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS

  1) Collection of run time statistics is enabled by #defining configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS as 1.
    Once this has been set the other two macros must also be defined to achieve a successful
    compilation.

  2) portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS()
    The run time statistics time base needs to have a higher resolution than the tick interrupt -
    otherwise the statistics may be too inaccurate to be truly useful. It is recommended to make the
    time base between 10 and 100 times faster than the tick interrupt. The faster the time base the
    more accurate the statistics will be - but also the sooner the timer value will overflow.

    If configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS is defined as 1 then the RTOS kernel will automatically call
    portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS() as it is started (it is called from within the
    vTaskStartScheduler() API function). It is intended that the application designer uses the macro
    to configure a suitable time base. Some examples are provided below.

  3) portGET_RUN_TIME_COUNTER_VALUE()

    This macro should just return the current 'time', as configured by
    portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS(). Again some examples are provided below.

  The vTaskGetRunTimeStats() API function is used to retrieve the gathered statistics.
